## Flow

Git Origins and History -> Setting up Git -> GitHub Sign Up -> Remote Repos -> Fork a Repo -> Clone a Repo -> Make/Manage Changes -> Pushing and Pulling -> Going Back in Time
IF TIME PERMITS Creating Repos (Remote and Local) -> Ignoring Files -> Branching and Merging -> Pull Requests -> Stashing Changes
